ðŸ”´ðŸ”µ Connect Four: Rules & Regulations ðŸ”µðŸ”´

ðŸ”¹ Objective: Connect Four is a classic two-player game where the goal is to be the first to form a line of four of your colored discs in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row on the game board.

ðŸ”¹ Setup: The game board consists of a 6x7 grid. Players take turns dropping colored discs (red or blue) from the top into a column of their choice.

ðŸ”¹ Gameplay: Players alternate turns, dropping one disc at a time into any of the seven columns. The disc falls to the lowest available space within the column.

ðŸ”¹ Winning: The game is won by the first player to create a line of four of their own discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If the game board fills up before either player achieves this, the game is a draw.

ðŸ”¹ Strategic Thinking: Success in Connect Four requires both offensive and defensive strategies. Players must simultaneously aim to form their own lines of four while blocking their opponent from doing the same.

ðŸ”¹ Etiquette: Sportsmanship and fair play are encouraged. Players should take turns respectfully and avoid disrupting the game flow. In case of disputes, a mutually agreed-upon resolution should be sought.

ðŸ”¹ Enjoyment: Above all, Connect Four is a game of fun and friendly competition. So gather your friends or family, strategize, and enjoy the challenge of connecting four in a row!
